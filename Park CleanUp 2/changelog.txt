Changelog of Park CleanUp: a tool to optimize RCT3 savegames.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------

2.0:
Description:
Fully recoded and focused on usability, v2.0 has been radically changed from previous versions. While it maintains the core features of the previous versions,
    new functions have been added and existing functions have been improved for optimal performance on modern computers.

Changes/Additions:
- Added an autoupdate function which is enabled by default
- Both load- and clean times have been vastly improved, especially on multicore computers.
- The interface has been redesigned to make it more userfriendly
- The tool can now open any RCT3 archive: parks, scenario's, structures, tracks, ..., however only park and scenario files should be cleaned
- Cleaning the parkfile should give better results
- Added an option to create a ZIP-file containing the cleaned parkfile and all required OVL files (the files in which custom content is saved)
	together in 1 file that can easily be shared with other people
- The function to see which custom content a park requires has been improved, making it more easy to use
- Plugins aren't supported anymore
- The error tester is not included anymore.
- The program isn't multilanguage anymore and I currently have no plans to reimplement it

1.1:
Changes/Additions:
- Added an easy way to change options in the new optionseditor
- Forgot to include the standard plugins in the 1.0 zip, they're included now
- A new program 'ErrorTester.exe' is now included in the package. This program basically is a 'virus-scanner' like tool
	which scans all your installed CSO/CTR (CFR's not yet) on errors like missing OVLs, 'No :svd for :sid' error and
	some other basic errors. It currently is in beta and is included as a test. Depending on how usefull people will
	find this tool I might stay updating it.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed a bug occuring on corrupted arrays, structs and lists datatypes which caused Park CleanUp to crash

1.0:
Changes/Additions:
- Added a 'Deselect items' option
- Added FlyingCameraRoute selection option: Thanks to Silver Swordsman from ShyGuysWorld.com for finding this!
- Cleaned and optimized some features (especially improved algorithms to make the tool a bit faster)
- Changed the name of the 'Create new archive' button to 'Save'
- Deleted the memory indicator at the program-title
- Added an options.ini file in which the tool will save it's options, it can be opened and edited with Notepad
- Added 2 new options in the file menu to scan for missing OVL files the park refers to and to create a list to see how much bytes each
	'database' of items takes into your parkfile.
- Added a loading indicator/splashscreen
- Added a simple plugin feature, see the samples for more information

Bug fixes:
- Some minor memory leaks are fixed now. Cause of these fixes the program should also use slightly less RAM
- When the program is closed the reading code will also stop now. In 0.43.5 there was a bug that reading would still go on till it
	was finished when the program was closed.
- Crashing at large files now shouldn't happen anymore. In 0.43.5 large files (as in files with over 50k in-file references) used to
	crash cause of an allocation error. This limit is now raised to 200k.

Known bugs:
- Crashes at empty archives (archives with no actual data, empty parks will open!)
- Memory leaks
